## Terminal Guide 1F

If you ever get lost (you don't know where you are, or you don't know where to go), look for the floor guide in this pic.

There's plenty of them, so you should be able to find one and get back on track pretty quickly.

## Charging Station

Here you'll find power outlets and USB Type-A ports that you can use to charge your devices for free.

You can use your chargers in these power outlets.

The sockets in Japan look like this. We call them コンセント（konsento） in Japanese; this is an example of 和製英語 (wasei-eigo), which are Japanese expressions based on English words but don't exist in standard English.

これは USB Type-A を使って充電できる場所です。

## To floor B1

Take an escalator to B1, where you'll be riding the train.

By the way, please stay on the left side on the escalator. Leave the right side open so people in a hurry can use it while walking.

## Terminal Guide (B1F)

To make sure you know where you are, I recommend checking the floor guides here as well.

You'll see some gacha machines here, but please resist the temptation to use them. Your money will be gone before you realize it.

Otherwise if you're on your way home and you have some extra cash, go ahead and have fun.

If you feel tired or unwell, please tell the airport staff. There's a clinic in the airport that you can get treatment at.

## From the gate to the ticket machines

Behind the pillar you'll find an information desk. Don't be afraid to ask for help here.

Same location, looking slightly to the right.

Onto the ticket vending machines. Look for the blue signage in this pic.

## Narita Airport's Ticket Machines

I buy the tickets, totaling 2740 yen. I used the Japanese setting here.

There's a button for changing the language at the top left; use this to switch to English when you use the machines.

The locations of each button are the same, even when set to English.

[![B1F ticket machine - YouTube](http://img.youtube.com/vi/K-SBlNw-O0Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-SBlNw-O0Q)

You'll get two tickets, one large and one small.

You'll be using both fairly soon, so I recommend keeping them on hand.
