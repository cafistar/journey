By the time you get on this train, you will be very tired.

But you can only find these JR Yamanote Line information screens on top of the doors.

Try your best to keep standing so you can see them; this might be hard when you're sitting down.

# My Impression

This guide describes my journey from Narita Airport to Ikebukuro.

It was really difficult; even though I can speak Japanese, I took the wrong train once.

Once you leave Narita Airport, you shouldn't expect anyone to speak English, although you might find someone who does if you're lucky.

Try to keep your phone charged at all times, because you might not be able to find the chargers/cables you need at the convenience stores. Either they're sold out, or sometimes they don't even sell them at all.

I don't have any pictures, but all of the stations have restrooms. You won't be able to use these once you get past the ticket gates.

It was tiring, but a really good and fun experience!
